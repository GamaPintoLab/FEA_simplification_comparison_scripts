# FEA_simplification_comparison_scripts


## DESCRIPTION

These scripts and functions are designed to perform  not only a Functional Enrichment Analysis (FEA) using **ClusterProfiler** R package  
but also to simplify the FEA results by applying gene-co-occurrence and semantic similarity-based simplification algorithms.  

Addditonaly, we can also perfom pair-wise comparisons between two FEA results to compare for example two experimental gene lists functional differences and similarities.  

Finally the repository provides scripts based on **ggplot2** R package to produce aesthetic and meaninfull plots to summarize these comparisons.
